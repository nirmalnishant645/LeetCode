'''
Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.

Example:

Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
Note:

Given n will always be valid.

Follow up:

Could you do this in one pass?
